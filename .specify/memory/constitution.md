# Sneaker Heart Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Simplicity First
Every feature must solve a real user need with the minimal viable implementation. Avoid premature optimization, over-engineering, or speculative features. Static generation is preferred over dynamic rendering when possible.

**Rationale**: As a minimal static webapp, complexity is our enemy. The project intentionally avoids backend infrastructure, authentication, and databases to maintain simplicity and fast iteration.

### II. Static-First Architecture
All pages MUST be statically generated at build time using Next.js static export. No server-side rendering, no API routes, no backend services.

**Rationale**: Static hosting (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages) provides zero-cost deployment, infinite scalability, and maximum reliability without infrastructure management.

### III. Component Reusability
UI components MUST be reusable and composable. Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling. Avoid inline styles or CSS modules unless absolutely necessary.

**Rationale**: Tailwind's utility-first approach combined with React components enables rapid development and consistent design without custom CSS overhead.

## Technology Stack

**Required Stack**:
- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router with static export)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Language**: TypeScript (preferred) or JavaScript
- **Package Manager**: npm, yarn, or pnpm

**Explicitly Excluded**:
- ❌ Authentication/login systems
- ❌ Databases (SQL, NoSQL, or otherwise)
- ❌ Backend APIs or server routes
- ❌ Testing frameworks (unit, integration, or e2e)
- ❌ State management libraries (Redux, Zustand, etc.) unless justified

**Optional Enhancements** (only when needed):
- Static data sources (JSON files, markdown)
- Third-party embeds (YouTube, maps, social media)
- Client-side interactivity (React hooks, local storage)

## Development Workflow

**Build Process**:
1. All features developed as static pages or components
2. Build verification via `next build` - MUST succeed
3. Visual verification in browser - no automated tests required
4. Deploy static output to hosting platform

**File Organization**:
- `/src/app` - Next.js pages and layouts (App Router)
- `/src/components` - Reusable React components
- `/public` - Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
- `/src/styles` - Global CSS and Tailwind config

**Quality Gates**:
- Code MUST compile without errors
- Pages MUST render correctly in browser
- Responsive design MUST work on mobile and desktop
- No broken links or missing assets

## Governance

This constitution defines the non-negotiable boundaries for Sneaker Heart development. All implementation decisions MUST align with the principles of simplicity, static architecture, and minimal dependencies.

**Amendment Process**:
- Constitution changes require explicit justification
- Version bumps follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Updated guidance documents MUST reflect constitutional changes

**Complexity Justification**:
If a feature requires deviation from these principles (e.g., adding a database, authentication, or dynamic API), it MUST be explicitly documented with:
1. Why the static approach is insufficient
2. What alternatives were considered
3. Migration plan and complexity assessment
