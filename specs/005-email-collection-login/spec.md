# Feature Specification: Email Collection Login Screen

**Feature Branch**: `005-email-collection-login`  
**Created**: 2025-10-03  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "login. Quiero hacer que se solicite el mail al ingresar. No sera un sistema de login completo, solo voy a acumular los mails para recopilar esa informacion de los usuarios. En la pantalla de splash screen luego de pasado el tiempo de la animacion, en vez de ir a la pantalla principal lo que deberia suceder es que el fondo rojo se levante como una persiana con una animacion y ahora pasara a ocupar 1/3 de la pantalla y el resto de la pantalla es blanco. Mientras se levanta como persiana el logo debera achicarse un 25%. En la parte blanca debera haber un texto que diga ingresa tu mail, debajo un input para que escriban el mai y debajo el boton que dija Ingresar. Una vez que ingresen el mail deberia almacenarse en alguna lado, se te ocurre algo que no sea una base de datos normal? Y ahi si poder acceder a la pantalla principal de la webapp."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a** first-time visitor to the Tinker sneaker app  
**I want to** provide my email address before accessing the main experience  
**So that** the app owner can collect contact information for future communications

### User Journey

**First-Time Users:**
1. User opens the app and sees the splash screen with red background and logo
2. After splash animation completes (2 seconds), red background "lifts up" like a window blind/curtain:
   - Animation duration: 1200ms (1.2 seconds)
   - Red area shrinks to occupy top 1/3 of screen
   - Logo scales down by 25% during the lift animation
   - Bottom 2/3 of screen reveals white background
3. White section displays:
   - Heading text: "Ingresa tu mail"
   - Email input field
   - "Ingresar" button (styled like CompletionScreen link)
4. User types their email address into the input field
5. User clicks "Ingresar" button
6. System validates email format (contains @ and domain)
7. Email is stored in Google Sheets with timestamp
8. localStorage flag set: "tinker_email_submitted" = true
9. User is redirected to the main sneaker swipe interface

**Returning Users** (who already submitted email):
1. User opens the app and sees normal splash screen (2 seconds)
2. NO blind-lift animation
3. NO email form
4. Directly redirected to main sneaker swipe interface after splash

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Successful email submission (Happy Path)**
- **Given** the splash animation has completed and user has NOT previously submitted email
- **When** the user enters a valid email (e.g., "user@example.com") and clicks "Ingresar"
- **Then** the email is stored in Google Sheets with timestamp
- **And** localStorage flag "tinker_email_submitted" is set to true
- **And** the user is redirected to the main sneaker card interface
- **And** the email screen does not appear again (permanent, even after browser close)

**Scenario 2: Invalid email format**
- **Given** the user is on the email collection screen
- **When** the user enters an invalid email (e.g., "notanemail") and clicks "Ingresar"
- **Then** error message "Ingresa un email v√°lido" is displayed
- **And** the user remains on the email screen
- **And** the input field retains the invalid value for correction

**Scenario 3: Empty email submission**
- **Given** the user is on the email collection screen
- **When** the user clicks "Ingresar" without entering any text
- **Then** error message "Por favor ingresa tu email" is displayed
- **And** the user remains on the email screen

**Scenario 4: Returning user (already submitted email)**
- **Given** localStorage contains "tinker_email_submitted" = true (from previous visit)
- **When** the user reopens the app
- **Then** normal splash screen is displayed for 2 seconds
- **And** NO blind-lift animation occurs
- **And** NO email collection form is shown
- **And** the user goes directly to the main sneaker swipe interface after splash

**Scenario 5: Animation behavior (first-time users only)**
- **Given** the splash animation has just completed (after 2 seconds) and user has NOT submitted email
- **When** the transition to email screen begins
- **Then** the red background area animates upward like a lifting blind/curtain over 1200ms
- **And** the red area settles at the top 1/3 of the viewport
- **And** the logo scales down to 75% of its splash screen size during the animation
- **And** the white email form area is revealed in the bottom 2/3
- **And** the animation feels smooth and natural

### Edge Cases

**Navigation & State**
- **Page refresh during entry**: Partially entered email is preserved (input value persists)
- **Browser close before submit**: Email NOT stored, user sees email form again on next visit
- **Duplicate email submissions**: ALLOWED - same email can be submitted multiple times (stored as separate entries in Google Sheets)

**Input Validation**
- **Maximum email length**: 254 characters (standard RFC 5321 limit)
- **Special characters**: Allowed per email spec (dots, hyphens, underscores, etc.)
- **Whitespace handling**: Automatically trimmed before validation

**Storage & Privacy**
- **Retention period**: Indefinite (stored in Google Sheets, managed manually by owner)
- **Deletion requests**: Not implemented (owner must manually delete from Google Sheets)
- **Storage failure**: Display error message "Hubo un error. Intenta nuevamente" and allow user to retry

**Responsive Behavior**
- **1/3 red, 2/3 white split**: Applies to viewport height on both mobile and desktop
- **Logo scaling**: Maintains aspect ratio during 25% size reduction
- **Form layout**: Vertically centered in white area with responsive padding

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
