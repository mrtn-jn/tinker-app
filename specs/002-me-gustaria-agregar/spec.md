**Created**: 2025-10-03  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "me gustaria agregar un splash screen. Que aparezca cada vez que se ingresa a la webapp simulando el arranque de una app. En este caso esta pantalla de bienvenida seria de color #ff0000, ancho y alto completo.

   ‚Üí Constraints: Full screen, centered logo, simulates app startup
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Duration of splash screen display]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Animation/transition type when exiting splash]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should splash show on every page refresh or only first visit per session?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be a loading indicator or just the static logo?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow identified: Entry ‚Üí Splash ‚Üí Main app
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí 15 requirements defined (some marked for clarification)
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí No persistent data entities involved
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - 4 clarifications needed"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for clarification phase)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: How long should the splash screen be displayed? ‚Üí A: 2 seconds minimum + wait for load
- Q: What type of transition animation should occur when exiting the splash screen? ‚Üí A: Fade out (smooth opacity transition)
- Q: How often should the splash screen appear? ‚Üí A: Every page load/refresh
- Q: Should the splash screen display a loading indicator or just the static logo? ‚Üí A: Pulsing logo animation
- Q: Should the splash screen display a loading indicator or just the static logo? ‚Üí A: Spinning/pulsing logo animation

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a user accessing the Sneaker Heart webapp, I want to see a branded splash screen with an animated logo when the app loads, so that I experience a native app-like startup that reinforces the brand identity and provides visual feedback that the app is loading.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I open the webapp URL for the first time, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see a full-screen red splash screen (#ff0000) with the centered Tinker logo
2. **Given** the splash screen is displaying, **When** 2 seconds minimum has elapsed AND main app is loaded, **Then** the splash screen smoothly transitions to the main app content
3. **Given** I refresh the page, **When** the page reloads, **Then** the splash screen appears again with full 2-second minimum display
4. **Given** the splash screen is visible, **When** I resize my browser window, **Then** the splash screen remains full-screen and the logo stays centered
5. **Given** I access the webapp on a mobile device, **When** the page loads, **Then** the splash screen fills the entire viewport and the logo scales appropriately

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the logo image fails to load? (Animation should gracefully degrade)
- How does the splash behave on slow network connections? (Pulsing continues until load complete)
- What happens if a user has very fast internet and assets load instantly? (Still respects 2-second minimum with pulsing)
- What if the user navigates back/forward in browser history? (Splash appears with full animation)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Display & Layout**
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a full-screen splash screen on webapp entry
- **FR-002**: Splash screen background MUST be solid red color (#ff0000)
- **FR-003**: Splash screen MUST cover the entire viewport (100% width and height)
- **FR-004**: Logo (tinker_splash.png) MUST be centered both horizontally and vertically
- **FR-005**: Logo MUST maintain its aspect ratio when displayed
- **FR-016**: Logo MUST display a pulsing animation during splash screen visibility to indicate loading activity

**Behavior & Timing**
- **FR-006**: Splash screen MUST appear before any other webapp content is visible
- **FR-007**: Splash screen MUST display for a minimum of 2 seconds AND wait until main app assets are loaded
- **FR-008**: Splash screen MUST transition to main app only after BOTH conditions are met: 2 second minimum elapsed AND app is ready
- **FR-009**: Splash screen MUST appear on every page load or refresh (no session-based suppression)

**Visual Transitions**
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide a fade out transition (smooth opacity animation) when exiting splash screen
- **FR-011**: Fade out transition MUST complete smoothly without jarring visual artifacts

**Responsive Design**
- **FR-012**: Splash screen MUST adapt to all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- **FR-013**: Logo MUST scale appropriately for different viewport sizes while remaining centered

**Loading Indicator**
- **FR-016**: Logo MUST have a subtle pulsing animation while splash screen is displayed
- **FR-017**: Pulsing animation MUST be smooth and continuous until transition begins
- **FR-018**: Animation MUST not be jarring or cause motion sickness (gentle pulse effect)

### Error Handling
- **FR-014**: If logo image fails to load, system MUST still display the red background splash screen
- **FR-015**: System MUST not block user access to app if splash screen encounters an error

## Review & Acceptance Checklist

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded

**Clarifications Needed:**
1. Duration of splash screen display
2. Animation/transition type when exiting splash
3. Frequency of splash screen appearance (every load, per session, etc.)
4. Loading indicator presence or static display only
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
